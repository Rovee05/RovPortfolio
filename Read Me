**Title: Assignment 1**
Short Description: Just a simple website about me for A1. Website includes a Homepage, Skills, Gallery and Contact me page. Programs used are html, css and Javascript.

Design Process: A mini portfolio desgined for future employers to see. This is for personal use for the potential of boosting my portfolio to increase my chances of 
                being employed. Best way to achieve it is to provide more informations and more features that would stand out.

Design Features:
        > Homepage: 
            1. 2 pictures of me
            2. Short Introducton of me
        > Skills:
            1. When the user clicks onto the page there is an animated bar of the confidnece I have in my fluency of the subject
            2. A short Description is written on the side. Sadly, no animation.
        > Gallery:
            1. When the user clicks on the page, they are greeted by a large gallery of my images.
            2. The initial colours of the images are in black and white/greyscaled, however, when the user hovers their mouse on the image, the colours will appear.
        > Contact:
            1. When the user clicks on the page, there is a small box containing ways to contact me.
            2. The user can fill in their details and questions on on the lines when they click on the box.

    Features I have yet to implement:
        > Animated buttons for transition from page to page. (Aesthetics)
        > A flexible web design that fits on various devices. E.g IPhone, Samsung, Pixel, etc.
        > Perhaps instead of rectagle/box shaped images, I should make them circular/more rounded.
        > A functioning quiz using javascript

Technologies used:
    1. html
    2. CSS
    3. Javascript
    4. Adobe XD - For framework/wireframe

Testing:
    > Contact page:
        1. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
        2. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
        3. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
    > Effect on various device sizes:
        1. When the size of the website becomes smaller, everything should conform properly to fill out the screen of the device.
            E.g When moving from desktop to an apple device, the website should be of that size.
        2. No problems should occur, if there is to be an error, an error screen should pop up.
